        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>Emergency medical services are a critical component of public healthcare systems. In India, thousands of lives are lost annually due to delays in ambulance response from road accidents, cardiac emergencies, and sudden medical crises. Project Lifeline is an innovative, app-based solution designed to transform ambulance booking, tracking, and emergency coordination.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the convenience of ride-hailing apps like Uber and Rapido, our goal is to bridge the gaps in India's fragmented emergency response network. The current system suffers from multiple inefficiencies, including the "Black Box of Emergency Calls," which leaves users with no visibility on ambulance arrival, and "Traffic Gridlock" that causes delays. Our project aims to address these issues that undermine the "Golden Hour" principle.</p>

        <h2>Proposed Solution: The Lifeline App</h2>
        <p>The Lifeline App makes emergency response as seamless as booking a cab.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**One-Tap Booking:** Instantly request the nearest available ambulance.</li>
            <li>**Live Tracking:** Track the ambulance in real time on a map.</li>
            <li>**Accurate ETA:** Get reliable estimates for arrival time.</li>
            <li>**Bystander Booking:** Book on behalf of unconscious or injured victims.</li>
            <li>**Communication Tools:** Use in-app chat or calls to provide critical details to paramedics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This solution reduces panic by providing visibility and enables preparation at the accident site.</p>
